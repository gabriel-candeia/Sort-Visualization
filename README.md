# Sort Visualization
## Description
A repo for a simple sorting algorithm visualization program I did to learn Javascript, HTML and CSS. My intention was to separate the "sorting" and "drawing" functions, in order to make it possible to reutilize the same "drawing" function in different "sorting" functions.
## To-Do List
* Improve drawing function when the width of the bar is less than 2px
* Improve sidenav and menu
* Improve the color of the bars during sorting
* Add more sorting functions
